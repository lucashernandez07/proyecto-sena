🎬 EvalPolicy – 4-Minute Team Pitch (English Version)

(3 people – time-coordinated script)

🧍‍♀️ [Person 1 — 0:00 – 1:00] — INTRO & PROBLEM

🎙️ (Warm, confident tone)

Every year, hundreds of new laws and social programs are proposed in Colombia —
but very few are evaluated with real data before they’re approved.

Many decisions are made with good intentions, but without evidence.
And that means millions invested… without knowing if we’re actually solving the problem.

We believe artificial intelligence can change that.

That’s why we created EvalPolicy — an AI agent that analyzes public policies before they’re implemented,
helping governments make decisions based on data, not intuition.

📺 (Slide shows the quote: “Govern with data, not assumptions.”)

🧍‍♂️ [Person 2 — 1:00 – 1:40] — SOLUTION

🎙️ (Technical but friendly tone)

EvalPolicy lets you either type or upload a document describing a policy.

In just seconds, it analyzes the content and produces a report showing benefits, risks, costs, and a general conclusion.

It uses a cutting-edge model — Llama 3.1 running on Groq — combined with a contextual knowledge base that adds real historical data.

💻 (Show the main interface or start the short demo video silently while speaking.)

⚙️ [DEMO — 1:40 – 2:30]

👩‍💻 [Person 2 – narrating while the demo plays]

Let’s try a quick example.
Here we upload a document about transportation subsidies for rural students.

EvalPolicy reads the text and automatically detects the key variable: rural education.

👨‍💻 [Person 3 – continues as results appear]

The AI then generates a structured report:
Benefits: improved school attendance.
Risks: higher government spending.
Costs: moderate budget increase.
Conclusion: positive policy if paired with fiscal monitoring.

📈 (The screen shows the final report layout — no need to scroll or code.)

🧍‍♂️ [Person 2 — 2:30 – 3:00] — HOW IT WORKS

🎙️ (Clear, concise tone)

Behind that analysis there are three layers of intelligence:

LLM: interprets the policy text and produces the main evaluation.

MCP: provides real contextual data from previous programs.

A2A: enables two AI agents to collaborate — one interprets, the other validates.

All results are stored in Supabase and can be retrieved or compared later.

🧍‍♀️ [Person 3 — 3:00 – 3:40] — IMPACT & VISION

🎙️ (Inspirational tone)

EvalPolicy doesn’t just analyze — it simulates scenarios.

It can show how dropout rates might change if transportation subsidies increase by 10 % or 20 %.

This tool empowers governments, researchers, and citizens to understand policy impact before acting.

It’s built with FastAPI and React, deployed on Render and Vercel, and ready to scale for real-world decisions.

More than technology, EvalPolicy represents a new way to govern with evidence, not assumptions.

💬 [ALL — 3:40 – 4:00] — GROUP CLOSING

(Alternate short phrases, smiling and confident)

👩‍💻 “We are [team name].”
👨‍💻 “We believe AI should never replace human decisions…”
👩‍💻 “…but it can definitely make them smarter.”

💚 This is EvalPolicy — data-driven decisions for a better future.

🎬 (Final slide: logo + tagline “Powered by AI for social impact.”)

🧠 Rehearsal tips

Keep each segment under its minute: 1:00 / 0:40 / 0:50 / 0:30 / 0:40 / 0:20.

Play a 30–45 sec muted demo video while Person 2 narrates.

Person 1 = Storytelling; Person 2 = Tech & demo; Person 3 = Vision & closing.

Use 5 slides total:
1️⃣ Problem 2️⃣ Solution 3️⃣ Demo 4️⃣ Architecture (LLM + MCP + A2A) 5️⃣ Impact & Closing.
